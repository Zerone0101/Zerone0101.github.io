Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

**Example:**

    Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
    Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
    Explanation: 

    Window position                Max
    ---------------               -----
    [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
    1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
    1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
    1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
    1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
    1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

**Note:** 
    You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.
**Follow up:**
Could you solve it in linear time?

**Discuss:**
1. keep a double end queue in the decreasing order
2. when a new num come, remove all the num in the tail which less than the new num, and add to the tail
3. if current index >= k, add the head num to the result array, and remove the head if head's index == currnet index - k

In fact, there is no need store  num and its index to the queue, only index is enough.
The time complexity is O(n), every num at most visit two times in queue.
The sapce complexity is O(k), there is at most k nums in queue.

**code:**
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if(n == 0) return new int[0];
        int [] res = new int[n-k+1];
        Deque<int[]> dq = new LinkedList<>();
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n){
            while(!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peekLast()[0] < nums[i]){
                dq.pollLast();
            }
            dq.offerLast(new int[] {nums[i], i});
            i += 1;
            if(i >= k){
                int[] first = dq.peekFirst();
                res[i-k] = first[0];
                if(i-k == first[1]) dq.pollFirst();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
