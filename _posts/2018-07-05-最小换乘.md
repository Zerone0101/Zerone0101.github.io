n个站点1-n，一个人需要从1出发到n，以及一些公交车的线路图，求出换乘次数最少的值，能够从站点1到站点n


输入描述:
The first line of the input contains two integer n and m, indicating the number of bus station and the number of bus routes respectively.
The following m lines describe the bus routes.
For each line, first there is an integer ki indicating the number of stations the bus will pass by, then followed by the ki stations.
The input guarantees there is at least one route from 1 to n.

2 <= n
2 <= $k_i$ <= n
30%   n <= 10,     m <= 10,   $\sum k_i <= 30$
70%   n <= 1000,   m <= 1000,   $\sum k_i <= 3000$ 
100%  n <= 100000, m <= 100000,  $\sum k_i <= 300000 $
输出描述:
Output a single line containing the minimum cost.
